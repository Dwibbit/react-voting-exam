# Software Documentation

## Overview of Components

The software is a single session voting software for multiple Pokemon categories. All data for the categories and individual Pokemon are loaded in a JSON file in the /src folder under data.json with an array for categories with objects for all Pokemon choices for that category. Additional categories can be added through adding objects of the same template.

The components are separated into App, CategoryGrid, and VoteCells.
The App component contains all of the components, in which multiple CategoryGrids can be loaded depending on how many Categories are retrieved from the data category array. Each category is mapped in the App for displaying each category data in the JSON. App also includes the button for submitting votes.
CategoryGrid shows multiple VoteCells, in which VoteCells show each individual vote data to vote in each given category.
VoteCells contain individual Pokemon data with name, picture, and vote button.

Votes submitted are stored in LocalStorage for allowing only one submission per unique user.

## React Hooks used

### useEffect, useState, useRef, useContext

#### useContext

CreateContext (DataContext) was used to create a context provider wrapper around the App and storing the values from the data.json file so they may be accessed anywhere among the child components (CategoryGrids and VoteCells)

#### useEffect

useEffect used in child components for detecting if data exists in LocalStorage to determine if a user has already voted upon load of each component

#### useState & useRef

useState and useRef were both used for state management in each component
